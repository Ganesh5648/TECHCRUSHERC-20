# ERC20 Token with Airdrop Functionality

A Solidity-based ERC20 token implementation built with Foundry, featuring airdrop capabilities, comprehensive testing, and detailed tokenomics.

## Project Overview

This project implements a standard ERC20 token with additional airdrop functionality. The token is designed for fair distribution and includes comprehensive documentation of its economic model and deployment strategy.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: ^0.8.30 (Smart contract development)
- **Foundry**: Development framework and testing suite
- **OpenZeppelin**: Battle-tested smart contract libraries
- **Anvil**: Local blockchain for development and testing

### Folder Details

#### `src/`
Contains all Solidity smart contracts. The main token contract lives here along with any utility contracts or libraries you create.

- **MyToken.sol**: The main ERC20 token implementation
- **utils/Constants.sol**: Centralized constants to avoid magic numbers in contracts

#### `script/`
Deployment and interaction scripts written in Solidity. Foundry uses Solidity scripts instead of JavaScript for better type safety and consistency.

- Scripts here are executed using `forge script` command
- Can include deployment scripts, upgrade scripts, or administrative scripts

#### `test/`
All test files for your smart contracts. Foundry uses Solidity for testing, providing a familiar environment.

- Test files follow the pattern `*.t.sol`
- Use Forge's testing framework with `forge test`
- Can include unit tests, integration tests, and fuzzing tests

#### `broadcast/`
**Automatically generated by Foundry** when you run deployment scripts with the `--broadcast` flag.

- Organized by script name and chain ID
- Contains complete deployment history with addresses, transaction hashes, gas used, etc.
- `run-latest.json` always points to the most recent deployment
- Historical deployments saved as `run-{timestamp}.json`

#### `docs/`
Comprehensive project documentation for users, investors, and developers.

- **TOKEN_ECONOMICS.md**: Detailed tokenomics including supply, distribution, and vesting
- **AIRDROP_GUIDE.md**: Instructions for executing and claiming airdrops
- **API_REFERENCE.md**: Technical documentation of all contract functions
- **DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md**: Optional manual notes about deployments

#### `lib/`
Foundry dependencies installed via `forge install`. Similar to `node_modules` in npm projects.

- Never edit files in this folder directly
- Managed by Foundry's package manager

#### `out/` and `cache/`
Auto-generated folders created by Foundry during compilation. These are ignored by git.

## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Network Configuration
ANVIL_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
CHAIN_ID=31337

# Deployment Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

# Token Configuration
TOKEN_NAME=TECHCRUSHTOKEN
TOKEN_SYMBOL=TCTN
INITIAL_SUPPLY=1000000000000000000000000
DECIMALS=18

# Airdrop Configuration
AIRDROP_AMOUNT=100000000000000000000
MAX_AIRDROP_RECIPIENTS=1000

# Optional: For Etherscan verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control! It contains sensitive information like private keys.

## Development Workflow

### Running a Local Blockchain

Start Anvil (Foundry's local blockchain):
```bash
anvil
```

This starts a local blockchain at `http://127.0.0.1:8545` with 10 pre-funded accounts.

### Deploying Contracts

Deploy to local Anvil:
```bash
forge script script/DeployToken.s.sol --rpc-url $ANVIL_RPC_URL --broadcast
```

Deploy to testnet (e.g., Sepolia):
```bash
forge script script/DeployToken.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
forge test
```

Run tests with verbosity:
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

Run specific test:
```bash
forge test --match-test testTokenTransfer
```

Run tests with gas reporting:
```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

### Finding Deployment Information

After deploying, find your contract address in:
```bash
broadcast/DeployToken.s.sol/{CHAIN_ID}/run-latest.json
```

Quick command to extract the contract address:
```bash
cat broadcast/DeployToken.s.sol/31337/run-latest.json | jq -r '.transactions[0].contractAddress'
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Token minting and initial supply
- Transfer functionality
- Approval and allowance mechanisms
- Airdrop distribution
- Edge cases and security considerations

Run the test suite before deploying to ensure everything works correctly.

## Security Considerations

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's audited implementations
- Private keys should never be committed to version control
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
- Consider professional audits for production deployments
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Contracts audited (for production)
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Token economics finalized and documented
- [ ] Deployment script tested on testnet
- [ ] Gas estimates calculated
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet set up (if applicable)
- [ ] Contract verification prepared
- [ ] Team informed of deployment timeline

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` folder:

- **[Token Economics](docs/TOKEN_ECONOMICS.md)**: Complete tokenomics breakdown
- **[Airdrop Guide](docs/AIRDROP_GUIDE.md)**: How to execute and claim airdrops
- **[API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)**: Technical contract documentation
